What should be done if the co-ordinator never confirms about the commit. 
How do i keep track of such a situation

Maintain a list of locks. []

Before changing anything append the key to this lock and after completing the task remove that. 



While statrting up the server, go check the log file. Check for all pending operations and roll them back

get_lock(item):
	if there is a existing lock:
		return false
	else:
		append item
		return lock

def wrte_to_sqlite(data, seq):
	genrate_sql to insert
	generte_sql_to_roll_back
	with lock wite_to_log_file (seq and roll back statment)
	method.save()

def commit():
	goback_back_to_log file search  for the entry of seq number and delete that entry from file


def put():
	if get_lock(key):
		write to the log file log file along with the sequence number
		write_key_to_sqlite()
